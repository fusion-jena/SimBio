# SimBio
## Semantic Similarity Assessment for Biomedical Terms 
SimBio is a semantic similarity assessment method by exploiting different knowledge resources to find the degree of proximity between your terms, where a numerical score quantifies this proximity as a function of the semantic evidence.  


Our similarity method is based on *Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm*. Please see our [publication]( https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-69459-7_11).

The tool is freely accessible through http://simbio.uni-jena.de/

This repository includes:
- Source code of the online tool
- PSO method implementation
- The manual mapping between WordNet and SNOMED-CT|MeSH


We have implemented our method based on Semantic Measures Library available in http://www.semantic-measures-library.org/sml/.

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
- Download the SML 
- Add our `PSO_package`
